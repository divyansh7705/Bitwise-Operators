# Bitwise-Operators
AIM :- <br>
to study and implement cpp bitwise operator <br>

Theory:-<br>
In C++, bitwise operators work with discrete bits of integral types. <br>{&} (AND), {|} (OR), {^{ (XOR), {~} (NOT), {<<} (left shift), and {>>} (right shift) are examples of common operators.<br> They carry out bit-level operations, making low-level programming and data manipulation effective.<br>

Algorithm : <br>
1)Start<br>

2)Initialize Variables: Declare variables a, b, x, y, z, w, and r as integers.<br>

3)Input Two Numbers:<br>

  -Prompt the user to enter two integers separated by a space.<br>
  -Read the integers into variables a and b.<br>
  
4)Perform Bitwise Operations:<br>

 -Bitwise OR: Calculate the result of a | b and store it in x.<br>
 -Bitwise XOR: Calculate the result of a ^ b and store it in y.<br>
 -Bitwise AND: Calculate the result of a & b and store it in z.<br>
 -Left Shift: Calculate the result of a << 1 and store it in w.<br>
 -Right Shift: Calculate the result of a >> 1 and store it in r.<br>
 
5) Output Results:<br>

 -Display the result of the bitwise OR operation: "Bitwise OR (a | b): x".<br>
 -Display the result of the bitwise XOR operation: "Bitwise XOR (a ^ b): y".<br>
 -Display the result of the bitwise AND operation: "Bitwise AND (a & b): z".<br>
 -Display the result of the left shift operation: "Left shift (a << 1): w".<br>
 -Display the result of the right shift operation: "Right shift (a >> 1): r".<br>

6) End<br>

Conclusion:- <br> 
in this experiment we learnt to use the bitwise operator in cpp <br>
